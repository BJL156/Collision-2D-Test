# Collision 2D Test
A 2D collision system in OpenGL.

## About
This project is a test on a collision system for OpenGL. This was made because collision is important in games and can make or break a game. There are objects called a `CollisionBox`. This is an area that can be checked for collision multiple can be add to an asset in a game to give it better collision. Below is an image.
